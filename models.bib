    abstract = "{Temperature-dependent clay mineral assemblages, vitrinite reflectance, and one-dimensional (1-D) thermal and three-dimensional (3-D) geological modeling of a Neogene wedge-top basin in the Sicilian fold-and-thrust belt and its pre-orogenic substratum allowed us to: (1) define the burial history of the sedimentary succession filling the wedge-top basin and its substratum, (2) reconstruct the wedge-top basin geometry, depocenter migration, and sediment provenance through time in the framework of a source-to-sink system, and (3) shed new light into the kinematic evolution of the Apennine-Maghrebian fold-and-thrust belt.The pre-orogenic substratum of the Scillato basin shows an increase in levels of thermal maturity as a function of stratigraphic age that is consistent with maximum burial to 3.5 km in deep diagenetic conditions. In detail, Ro\\% values range from 0.40\\% to 0.94\\%, and random ordered illite-smectite (I-S) first converts to short-range ordered structures and then evolves to long-range ordered structures at the base of the Imerese unit. The wedge-top basin fill experienced shallow burial (∼2 km) and levels of thermal maturity in the immature stage of hydrocarbon generation and early diagenesis. Vitrinite reflectance and mixed-layer I-S values show two populations of authigenic and inherited phases. The indigenous population corresponds to macerals with Ro\\% values of 0.33\\%–0.45\\% and I-S with no preferred sequence in stacking of layers, whereas the reworked group corresponds to macerals with Ro\\% values of 0.42\\%–0.47\\% and short-range ordered I-S with no correlation as a function of depth.Authigenic and reworked components of the Scillato basin fill allowed us to unravel sediment provenance during the Neogene, identifying two main source areas feeding the wedge-top basin (crystalline units of the European domain and sedimentary units of the African domain), and to detect an early phase of exhumation driven by low-angle extensional faults that predated Neogene compression.}",

  abstract = { Three-dimensional (3D) model restoration is a powerful model validation technique which typically requires knowledge of rock mechanical parameters for every layer in the model, as well as boundary conditions. These may be difficult to evaluate and to input into restoration software. In this paper, we present a method which geometrically restores complex 3D structural models without relying on mechanical parameters. In an adaptation of the mathematical GeoChron framework, we compute a restoration transformation for particular geological times in the initial model from present day geometry and the uvt deposition coordinates, providing innovative consistency constraints and validation metrics. No user intervention is required at any time during the process and faults are automatically taken into account in the computation with no added steps required to eliminate gaps and overlaps. Once the restoration transformations are associated to the input model, the 3D structure can be restored to any intermediate state quickly enough to enable browsing through its geological history. We compare our results to previous attening techniques and show the potential of our method for interpretation validation. }

  abstract = { Between data acquisition and first oil or gas", a number of conventional workflows produce information which helps decision makers to define the best possible reservoir engineering parameters for production. Data are processed, imaged, migrated, interpreted, modelled, gridded and fed to flow simulators to perform reservoir assessments. Each of these steps comes with its own attached uncertainty which is often not propagated and considered all along the workflow. \\ \\Uncertainty evaluation is already a strong part of reservoir characterisation at the rock property modelling stage. Assessing uncertainty on reservoir structure, one step earlier in the workflow, is still not standard in our culture because of the complexity of such a task. \\ \\Relying on the strength of describing a structural model as a consistent volume linked to the depositional space, the GeoChron framework offers a theoretical background in which each source of uncertainty can be analysed, modelled independently and integrated consistently into different realisations of a structural model. For a number of years, uncertainty on fault and horizon picking, as well as fluid contact positions, has been part of the structure uncertainty modelling workflow based on the GeoChron theory.\\ \\Before horizons and faults can be picked, seismic data has to be imaged and migrated to create a representation of the subsurface. Those complex processes rely on a velocity model which is, in itself, uncertain. In this paper, we show how uncertainty on the velocity model can be very simply integrated by geomodellers into the structural uncertainty modelling workflow without requiring extensive geophysical knowledge. We validate the approach by comparing results from this velocity uncertainty method to time to depth conversions using velocity models which have been altered to reflect the same shifts in velocities. Finally, a case study shows how velocity uncertainty modelling can be integrated in the current structural uncertainty workflow, thus helping to start considering uncertainty around the velocity model and hopefully leading to further integration with geophysical tools such as tomography.\\ }
